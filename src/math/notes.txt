GCD (Greatest Common Divisor)
    - Largest number that divides each of the integers
    - What is the greatest common divisor of 54 and 24?

    The numbers that these two lists share in common are the common divisors of 54 and 24:
    Common divisiors : {1,2,3,6 }. The greatest of these is 6. That is, the greatest common divisor of 54 and 24. One writes:

    gcd(54,24) = 6

    Euclid's Algorithm to get GCD
        - m/n -> Quotient -> q ; Remainder -> r
        - Till remainder is 0
            -> m = n ; n = r; ie (n/r -> ...)
         - If r =0 ; then Quotient is the GCD
