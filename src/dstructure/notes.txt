Arrays - Fixed length /capacity; Random access ; Elements stored in sequence.
    int[] a0 = new int[5];
    int[] a1 = {1, 2, 3};
    Arrays.sort(a1);
    for (int item: a1) { ..}
    a[4] = 108;
    a1.length
    System.arraycopy(arr1, 2, arr2, 0, 7);
    2-Dimensional Array

ArrayList
    Variable Length  - Dynamic Array; Random access ; Internally LinkedList
    List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<Integer>();
    list = Arrays.asList(a1);
    list.size();
    Collections.sort(list);
    list.get(4);
    list.remove(v1.size() - 1); -> remove last element

String
    an array of unicode characters

Stacks and Queues are abstract data types coz they are conceptual and are internally represented using arrays or linked lists.

Stack
    LIFO
    Peek -> See last element without removing it from stack.
    Push, Pop, Peek -> O (1)
Queue
    FIFO
    Enqueue -> Add/Insert element to end of Queue
    Dequeue -> Remove/Delete element from beginning of Queue
    Pointers -> (Front / head ) , (Back / tail)


Algorithm
    - Exact Sequence of Rules / Operations to solve a problem that can be repeated.
    - How good is it ?
        - Space it takes ( not such a big deal these days as RAM is cheaper)
        - Time it takes - Time Analysis
            - Growth of time for Large data sizes . Linear or Quadratic Growth-> Asymptotic Analysis.
            - Assume infinite rama and that data is in ram.
