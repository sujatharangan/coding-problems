public class String {

    /*In Java, since the string is immutable, concatenation works by first allocating enough space for the new string, copy the contents from the old string and append to the new string.

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            s += "hello";
        }
            Therefore, the time complexity in total will be:

            5 + 5 × 2 + 5 × 3 + … + 5 × n
    = 5 × (1 + 2 + 3 + … + n)
            = 5 × n × (n + 1) / 2,
       which is O(n2).
    StringBuilder, StringBuffer -> O(n)
